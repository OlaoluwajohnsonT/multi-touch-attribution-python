# Multi-Touch Attribution in Python

## Project Brief
This project implements **multi-touch attribution (MTA)** models in Python to evaluate marketing channel contributions to conversions.  
It combines rule-based, probabilistic, and predictive approaches to guide **data-driven budget allocation**.

## Aim
- Quantify the true contribution of each channel and campaign.  
- Support budget reallocation decisions for improved ROI.  
- Provide an interpretable framework for marketers and analysts.

## Models Implemented
- **Rule-Based:** First-Touch, Last-Touch, Linear, Position-Based, Time-Decay  
- **Probabilistic:** Markov Chain (removal effect)  
- **Game-Theoretic:** Shapley Value Attribution  
- **Predictive:** Logistic Regression (conversion likelihood modeling)  

## Key Insights
- **Referral & Display Ads** consistently emerge as strong assist drivers.  
- **Direct & Email** are over-credited in simple rule-based models.  
- **Shapley attribution** is the most balanced and recommended as the primary model.
